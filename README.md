# Natural Language Processing

## Overview

This project is designed to manage a Django application, focusing on natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The primary utility script, `server.py`, allows you to run the Django server and create new projects easily.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- Django (latest version)
- Django's `django-admin` command line tool

You can install Django using pip:

```bash
pip install requirements.txt
```

## Creating a project
Help us to be bigger!

```bash

# First create a APP
python server.py create_project=nome_qualquer

# Now you can run the environment server
python server.py run

```

Good luck!
