        <h1>Stemming</h1>
        <p>
            Stemming is the process of reducing words to their root or base form. The purpose of stemming is to remove
            suffixes from words to create a uniform representation of the word for natural language processing tasks
            such as information retrieval, search engines, and text analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
            The most commonly used stemming algorithm is the Porter Stemmer, developed by Martin Porter in 1980.
            The Porter Stemmer applies a set of rules to iteratively remove suffixes from words, making it highly
            efficient
            and widely used in search engines and NLP applications
            (<a href="https://tartarus.org/martin/PorterStemmer/">Porter, 1980</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
            Another well-known algorithm is the Lancaster Stemmer, also called the Paice-Husk Stemmer, developed by
            Chris Paice and Gareth Husk. The Lancaster Stemmer is known for being more aggressive in reducing words to
            their base forms compared to the Porter Stemmer. It can create more drastic changes, which sometimes leads
            to
            overstemming (<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221063585_An_Aggressive_Stemming_Algorithm">
                Lancaster, 1990</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
            Although stemming is a useful technique, it can sometimes lead to issues such as overstemming (where too
            much
            of the word is removed) or understemming (where not enough of the word is removed). This is where more
            modern
            techniques like lemmatization offer a more precise approach to word normalization.
